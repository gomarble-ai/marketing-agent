# Meta Ads - Creative Analysis Workflow

> Metric definitions (Hook Rate, Hold Rate, CTR, performance benchmarks, video funnel) live in `meta/tool-fundamentals` and auto-load with this skill. Do NOT redefine them here. This skill is the workflow for diagnosing creative performance after the metrics are loaded.

## Inputs You Need

Before applying this skill, ensure you have:
- Ad-level video metrics (`video_play_actions`, `video_thruplay_watched_actions`, `actions` with `video_view`) — see `tool-fundamentals` for the exact fields and the Hook/Hold formulas.
- Account-level Hold Rate baseline from a 90-day account-level pull.
- Pareto set of ads (cumulative spend ≤ 90%).

## Diagnostic Scenarios for Video Ads

Apply the benchmarks from `tool-fundamentals` (Hook Rate / Hold Rate / CTR thresholds) to classify each Pareto video ad into one of these scenarios.

### Scenario 1: Good Hook, Poor Hold
- Hook Rate Good (≥ 40%), Hold Rate Poor (< Account Avg), CTR Average
- **Root cause**: Hook stops scroll, but content loses interest after 3 seconds.
- **Fix**: Keep the intro/hook. Rebuild seconds 3+ — move value prop earlier, show product sooner, use variety (B-roll + testimonial + selfie mix), keep value props concise.

### Scenario 2: Average Everything
- Hook Rate Average (26–39%), Hold Rate ≈ Avg, CTR Average
- **Root cause**: Nothing stands out. Room for improvement everywhere.
- **Fix**: Priority 1 — improve hook first (if they don't stop, nothing else matters). Use `facebook_analyze_ad_creative_by_id_or_url` to assess visual relevance and messaging. Then rebuild remaining clips for hold rate.

### Scenario 3: Poor Hook
- Hook Rate Poor (< 25%), Hold Rate any, CTR any
- **Root cause**: People aren't stopping to watch.
- **Fix**: Rebuild hook completely. Compare to hooks in top-performing ads. Test variations: different visual opening, text overlay, audio hook, problem vs benefit statement, question vs statement.

### Scenario 4: Great Hook + Hold, Poor CTR
- Hook Rate Good, Hold Rate > Acct Avg + 25%, CTR Poor (< 0.65%)
- **Root cause**: People watch the whole video but don't click. CTA weak or unclear.
- **Fix**: Check comments for negative sentiment. If fine — strengthen CTA (more prominent visual, clearer verbal, urgency/scarcity, better landing page alignment).

## Decision Framework by Ad Format

### Single Image
- High CPM (30%+ above Pareto avg) + Low ROAS → **Pause ad** (expensive audience, not converting).
- Low CTR (30%+ below Pareto avg) + Low ROAS → Check comments first. If fine, test variations with stronger CTA.
- Good metrics (within 20% of Pareto avg) → Create variations (copy, angle, or format).

### Single Video
- Apply Scenarios 1–4 above based on the Hook / Hold / CTR profile.
- High CPM + Low ROAS → Pause ad.
- Low CTR + Low ROAS → Check comments, then test stronger CTA variations.

### Advantage+ Catalog
- Meta does NOT provide conversion data per product ID.
- Use spend + CTR as proxy for product performance.
- High CPM + Low ROAS → Pause ad, test different product set.
- Low CTR + Low ROAS → Identify low-CTR products and remove from set.

## Creative Content Analysis

Use `facebook_analyze_ad_creative_by_id_or_url` to get subjective analysis of:
- Main angle, assumed user persona, ad format
- Visual elements, visual hook quality (video), audio hook quality (video)

Always show the creative metric visualization when using this tool successfully.

## Pattern Recognition Across Top Ads

Among top Pareto ads, analyze each with `facebook_analyze_ad_creative_by_id_or_url` to identify:
- Common angle patterns (which selling points repeat across winners)
- Common format patterns (image vs video vs carousel)
- Common hook patterns (videos — what stops the scroll)
- Common copy patterns (tone, length, structure)

Use winning patterns to guide new creative variations.

## Variation Strategy

**When ad performs well**: Copy variations (same angle, different words) → Angle variations (different selling point) → Format variations (same message, different format) → Hook variations (videos).

**When ad performs poorly**:
| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Hook Rate poor | Rebuild hook using winning hooks |
| Hook good, Hold poor | Rebuild middle section |
| Hook good, Hold good, CTR poor | Strengthen CTA |
| All metrics poor | Test completely new approach |
