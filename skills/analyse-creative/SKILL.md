description: "Use when the user asks which ads or creatives are winning and why, whether creatives are fatiguing, what hooks, formats or angles work, or wants a single ad broken down. Ranks creative by hook rate, hold rate, CTR, CPA and ROAS on Meta, TikTok and Google, reads the actual creative (visual, copy, hook, psychology), and finds the patterns worth carrying into the next brief."

# Analyse creative

Give every ad a creative analyst. See why each ad won, spot fatigue before it costs another week, and carry the strongest pattern into the next brief.

## When to use

- "Which of my ads are winning, and why?"
- "Are my creatives fatigued?"
- "Find my winning creative combos."
- "Break down this ad" (an ad ID, a link or an uploaded file).
- "What hooks and formats work for us?"

For competitor creative, use `research-competitors`. To turn findings into a brief, use `brief-creative`.

## Workflow

### 1. Rank creative against performance

Pull ad-level performance for the period (default: last 30 days; 28 days split into first and last 7 for fatigue). Include spend, impressions, CTR, CPA/ROAS, frequency and video metrics.

- **Meta:** `facebook_get_adaccount_insights` at ad level (active ads, impressions > 0, sorted by spend). Paginate with `facebook_fetch_pagination_url` before ranking. Work on the ads that make up 90% of spend.
- **TikTok:** `tiktok_get_creative_report` for per-material spend and engagement, or `tiktok_get_basic_report_enhanced` at ad level.
- **Google:** `google_ads_run_gaql` over ad and asset performance. For PMax, asset performance labels (BEST / GOOD / LOW).

Compute hook rate (3-second views ÷ video plays) and hold rate (ThruPlays ÷ 3-second views) and compare with the account's own averages. Methodology: `meta-creative-analysis` and `own-creative-diagnosis`.

### 2. Read the creative itself

For the top and bottom performers, read what's actually in the ad:
- Meta ads: `facebook_analyze_ad_creative_by_id_or_url` with `ad_id` and `act_id`. For the raw spec (copy, links, UTMs), `facebook_get_ad_creative_details`.
- Google or any asset URL: `facebook_analyze_ad_creative_by_id_or_url` with `assetUrl`.
- TikTok: get the media with `tiktok_get_ad_creative_url`, then analyze it by `assetUrl`. For Smart Creative (ACO) ad groups, `tiktok_get_smart_creative`.

This returns the visual, messaging, hook, psychology and proof, so you can say *why* an ad works, not just that it does.

### 3. Find the patterns and the fatigue

- **Winning patterns:** shared angles, hooks, formats, personas and CTAs across the top ads. Apply `creative-psychology-hooks` to explain why a hook works.
- **Fatigue:** frequency up and CTR down more than 20% (first vs last 7 days) = fatigued; 15–20% = creeping in. Classify each ad as Healthy, Early warning, Fatigued or Dead.
- **Diagnosis by scenario** (`meta-creative-analysis`): good hook but poor hold means rebuild the middle; poor hook means rebuild the opening; good hook and hold but low CTR means strengthen the CTA.

## Output

1. **Ranking:** a table of the top creatives with spend, hook rate, hold rate, CTR, CPA/ROAS and status (scale, keep, refresh, pause).
2. **Why the winners win:** the shared pattern, with the creative evidence.
3. **Fatigue report:** ads losing effectiveness and what to do about each.
4. **Next tests:** 3–5 variations to make, in priority order (copy, then angle, then format, then hook).

Offer to turn the patterns into a production brief (`brief-creative`).

## Acting on it

To pause fatigued ads or turn on new variations, hand off to `manage-campaigns`. Changes go dry run → the user approves in chat → live.

## Put it on a schedule

Offer a weekly creative fatigue monitor or creative strategist agent (see `automate-with-agents`).

## Limits

- Creative analysis uses GoMarble credits and depends on the plan. If `facebook_analyze_ad_creative_by_id_or_url` isn't available, analyze from metrics and the creative spec, and say the deep read wasn't available.
- Several TikTok tools are in a beta that may not be enabled for the account. If a tool says so, tell the user and continue with the tools that work.
