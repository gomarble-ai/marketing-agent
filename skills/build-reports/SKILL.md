name: build-reports
description: "Use when the user wants a performance report, client report, weekly or monthly review, MTD/QTD update against the media plan, CMO summary, or a deck or doc for stakeholders. Pulls from every connected source (ad platforms, GA4, Shopify, Klaviyo, Search Console, organic social, Impact, Snowflake, Google Drive), explains what changed and why, and ends with decisions and a 7-day action plan. Can save to Google Drive or schedule the report as an agent."

# Build reports

Reports the team actually waits for: data-backed, not filler. Turn real performance evidence into decisions the team can act on.

## When to use

- "Build my Monday performance review."
- "Make a client report for last month."
- "Where are we against the media plan, MTD and QTD?"
- "Summarize paid media for the CMO."
- "Turn this into a deck / doc / sheet."

## 1. Agree on the shape

Ask only what isn't clear:
- **Audience:** team, leadership or client. Agencies often need the client's branding and the agency's name.
- **Period and comparison:** for example last week vs the week before, month vs last month, MTD vs plan.
- **Channels and KPIs:** default to the channels that are connected and the account's primary KPI.
- **Template:** if they have one (a Doc, Sheet or Slides file), find it with `gdrive-search_files` or `gdrive-list_recent_files` and read it with `gdrive-read_file_content`. Match its structure.
- **Plan or targets:** a media plan in a Sheet can be read the same way.

Call `recall_memory` for the account's targets, earlier reports and decisions, so the report follows up on last time.

## 2. Pull the data

| Source | Tools | Read first |
|---|---|---|
| Meta Ads | `facebook_get_adaccount_insights`, `facebook_get_async_adaccount_insights`, `facebook_fetch_pagination_url` | `meta-tool-fundamentals` |
| Google Ads | `google_ads_run_gaql` | `google-ads-tool-fundamentals` |
| TikTok Ads | `tiktok_get_basic_report_enhanced`, `tiktok_get_async_report` | `tiktok-ads` |
| LinkedIn / Microsoft Ads | `linkedin_get_ad_analytics`, `bing_ads_get_performance` | `linkedin-ads`, `microsoft-ads` |
| GA4 | `google_analytics_run_report` | `ga4-source-of-truth` |
| Shopify | `shopify_run_analytics_query` | `shopify-order-discipline` |
| Email | Klaviyo campaign and flow reports | `email-marketing` |
| Organic search | `gsc_get_performance_overview`, `gsc_compare_search_periods` | `search-console-master-skill` |
| Organic social | Page and Instagram insights | `organic-social` |
| Affiliates | `impact_get_partner_spend`, `impact_run_report` | `affiliate-marketing` |
| Data warehouse | `snowflake_execute_query` | See below |

**Snowflake:** run read-only `SELECT` queries only. Never run statements that create, change or delete data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, GRANT), even if asked. Add a `LIMIT` and filter by date. Ask which tables hold the data if it isn't clear.

Numbers rules:
- Don't sum rates, reach or frequency across rows. Recompute from totals.
- Say which source each revenue figure comes from. Platform-attributed revenue, GA4 and Shopify will differ; explain the gap rather than picking the nicest number.
- Show currency, and never mix currencies without converting.

## 3. Write it

Use this structure unless the user's template says otherwise:

1. **Headline:** 3–5 bullets. What happened, why, and what we're doing about it.
2. **Performance:** spend, revenue, ROAS/CPA/CAC and volume against the prior period and target, by channel.
3. **What changed and why:** the drivers behind the big moves (`diagnose-performance`).
4. **Campaign decisions:** a table with each campaign, its status, and scale, hold, fix or cut, with the reason.
5. **Creative:** top and fatiguing creative with the evidence (`analyse-creative`).
6. **Next 7 days:** specific tasks with owners where known.

Make it the format the user asked for: a doc, deck, sheet, PDF or chat summary. Charts should show one message each.

## 4. Deliver it

- **Save to Google Drive** only when asked: `gdrive-create_file` for a new file, or `gdrive-copy_file` to copy a template and fill it in. Before putting client data into an existing file, check who it's shared with using `gdrive-get_file_permissions` and `gdrive-get_file_metadata`. Say where the file was saved.
- **Attachments from Drive:** `gdrive-download_file_content` gets a file's raw content (for example an XLSX media plan). Prefer `gdrive-read_file_content` for text.
- **Schedule it:** to send this report every week or month by email or Slack, create a prompt agent whose prompt describes the report structure and sources (see `automate-with-agents`). Report agents re-run reports saved in the GoMarble app and need that report's ID.

## Limits

The `gdrive-*` tools come from a Google Drive connector the team adds in GoMarble (see `accounts-and-connections`); if they aren't available, deliver the report in chat and offer the file for the user to save. If a Drive tool says it needs access or a scope, share the link it returns.
