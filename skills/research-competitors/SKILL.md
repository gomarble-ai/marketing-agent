description: "Use when the user wants to know what competitors are running: their ads, angles, hooks, offers and formats, which concepts they're scaling, who the competitors even are, or where the market gap is. Searches GoMarble's ad library by brand, domain, keyword or niche, groups patterns, flags what's new since the last scan, and turns the gap into the next test."

# Research competitors

See the angles, hooks and formats competitors are testing. Group the patterns, spot what they're scaling, and turn the right market gap into the next test for this brand.

## When to use

- "What ads are my competitors running?"
- "Who are my competitors?" (they don't need to know)
- "What angles are brands in my category leaning into?"
- "Find ads about [product / problem] that are working."
- "What's new from competitors since last week?"

## Workflow

### 1. Find the competitors

- If the user names them, resolve each with `ads_library_search_brands`, preferring the domain over the name.
- If not, start from the brand's URL or name with `ads_library_find_competitors`. It returns the category, products, keywords and up to five competitors. Confirm the list with the user if it matters.
- Starting from a category, problem or creative pattern instead of brands also works: use `ads_library_discover_ads` with a keyword and optional `niches`.
- Call `recall_memory` for known competitors and earlier competitor reports, so this scan can focus on what changed.

### 2. Pull their ads

- `ads_library_get_ads_by_brand_id` for each competitor, or `ads_library_discover_ads` for keyword and category searches.
- Always start with `start_date` 90 days ago and `order: "longest_running"`, which surfaces proven winners first. If that returns nothing, retry without dates.
- `ads_library_get_brand_analytics` for each brand's scale: active ad count, format and platform mix, and trend.
- `ads_library_analyze_ad` on the most promising ads, for full detail and duplicate variations. Many variations of one concept is a scaling signal.
- For Instagram presence, `instagram_discover_business` reads a competitor's public Business or Creator profile and recent posts (it needs one of the user's own Instagram Business accounts as the requester).

### 3. Group and prioritize

Apply `competitor-ad-intelligence` and `creative-research`:
- Group ads by repeated angle, hook, offer and format across competitors.
- Rank by investment signals: running duration (evergreen), repeated recent variations (breakout), active variations, and category momentum.
- Compare with the previous scan and highlight new ads, changed offers and rising angles, not the same ads every week.
- Connect each gap to this brand's own audience, proof and winning patterns (`analyse-creative`). Extract the strategic structure; never copy a competitor's ad.

## Output

1. **Competitor intelligence:** new and scaling ads grouped by angle, with source ads linked and why each matters.
2. **Market gaps:** angles competitors are scaling that this brand isn't testing, and whitespace nobody is covering.
3. **What to test next:** 3–5 prioritized concepts, each tied to the evidence.

Offer to turn the top concepts into a brief (`brief-creative`, or `winning-ads-orchestrator` for the full research-to-brief pipeline).

## Put it on a schedule

Offer a weekly competitor radar agent that reports only new and changed concepts (see `automate-with-agents`).

## Limits

Ad library searches use GoMarble ad library credits, charged per ad returned. Keep `limit` reasonable and paginate only when the analysis needs more.
