# Organic social (Facebook Pages and Instagram)

Analyze the brand's organic Facebook and Instagram through GoMarble: what content works, what people say, and which posts deserve paid budget. The connector reads organic data; it doesn't publish or reply.

## Setup

- Facebook Pages: `facebook_page_list` lists the Pages the user manages. `facebook_page_get_info` gives a Page's profile and follower count.
- Instagram: `instagram_list_accounts` lists the Instagram Business accounts linked to those Pages. `instagram_get_profile_info` gives the profile, followers and media count.
- Insights lag by up to 48 hours. Say so when the user asks about the last day or two.

## Tools

| Need | Facebook Page | Instagram |
|---|---|---|
| Posts | `facebook_page_list_posts` (fetch every page with `facebook_page_fetch_pagination_url`) | `instagram_list_media` (filter by type and date) |
| Account-level insights: reach, views, engagement, follows | `facebook_page_get_insights` | `instagram_get_account_insights` (most metrics `period=day`; demographics `period=lifetime` with a timeframe) |
| Per-post insights | `facebook_page_get_post_insights` (up to 20 posts per call) | `instagram_get_media_insights` (up to 20 per call; use metrics valid for the media type) |
| Comments | `facebook_page_get_post_comments` | `instagram_get_media_comments` |
| Content others tagged the brand in | | `instagram_list_tagged_media` (public counts only) |
| Another brand's public profile and recent posts | | `instagram_discover_business` (Business and Creator accounts only; see `research-competitors`) |

## How to analyze

- **What works.** Rank posts by reach and engagement rate (engagements ÷ reach), not raw likes. Compare formats (reel, carousel, image, video), topics and posting times. Use the account's own averages as the baseline.
- **What people say.** Read comments for the exact words customers use about the problem, objections and outcomes, plus recurring questions and complaints. Feed this into `brief-creative`.
- **User-generated content.** Tagged media shows creators and customers already talking about the brand: candidates for whitelisting, Spark Ads or UGC briefs.
- **Organic to paid.** Posts with unusually high reach or saves are strong candidates to run as ads. Recommend which ones and why (`launch-campaigns`).
- **Growth.** Follower growth, reach trend and demographics over time. Is the audience the brand's buyer?
- Comments and tagged posts are other people's content. Summarize and quote briefly; don't repost them.

## Output

Top and bottom content with the reason, what the audience is saying, UGC worth using, posts to put paid budget behind, and a short content plan for what to post more of.
