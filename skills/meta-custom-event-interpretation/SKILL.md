# Meta Custom Event Interpretation

> ### ⚠️ HIGHEST-PRIORITY RULE — read before any campaign performance audit, recommendation, pause, scale, or optimization-event change involving Meta campaigns
>
> **Trigger:** Any campaign you encounter where `objective ∈ {OUTCOME_SALES, CONVERSIONS, PURCHASES}` AND `optimization_goal / promoted_object.custom_event_type = COMPLETE_REGISTRATION`.

> **Required first action:** Your VERY FIRST tool call about that campaign — before `submit_recommendations`, before any `facebook_propose_update_*`, before mentioning the campaign in any audit table or "campaigns to improve" list — MUST be a `user_input` asking whether `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` is the user's 3rd-party-tracker (Profitmetrics / Cosmise / Triple Whale) purchase proxy or a genuine registration action.
>
> **For Nordic accounts (DKK / SEK / NOK / EUR, or chat in Danish / Swedish / Norwegian / Finnish):** name **Profitmetrics** explicitly in the question — it is the dominant 3rd-party tracker in this region and is the most common reason for this configuration. Example Danish framing:

## Purpose
Prevent the agent from treating Meta's non-purchase / non-transaction conversion events as proxies for actual revenue, purchases, or business outcomes. The most common failure modes the agent must block:

- Treating `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` (CR) as a purchase signal.
- Treating `LEAD` or `SUBSCRIBE` as evidence of revenue.
- Recommending optimization-event changes (e.g., "switch to PURCHASE") based on a CR-only chart.
- Comparing CPA for `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` to CPA for `PURCHASE` as if they measured the same thing.

This skill auto-loads alongside any Meta Ads analysis where a custom or non-PURCHASE conversion event is being discussed.

---

## Core Principle

The same Meta event name can mean very different things across accounts. `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` in one account is "completed checkout step 2"; in another it's "newsletter signup"; in another it's "free-trial start"; in another it's the same as purchase. The agent must:

1. Verify what the event represents in THIS account before drawing any conclusion.
2. Never equate a non-PURCHASE event with revenue.
3. Never recommend a change in optimization event without first confirming what event the account is actually tracking and pricing on.

---

## Rule 1 — Verify the Event Before Interpreting

When the user asks about CPA, ROAS, conversion volume, performance, or scaling — and the campaign is optimized for `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION`, `LEAD`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `ADD_TO_CART`, `INITIATE_CHECKOUT`, `VIEW_CONTENT`, `CONTACT`, `SUBMIT_APPLICATION`, `SCHEDULE`, `START_TRIAL`, `CUSTOMIZE_PRODUCT`, `DONATE`, `FIND_LOCATION`, `OTHER` or any custom event — the agent must:

1. State explicitly what event the campaign is optimizing for: "This campaign optimizes for `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION`, not `PURCHASE`."
2. Note that the metric the user is looking at (CPA / conversion volume / etc.) refers to that event, not a purchase.
3. Refuse to compute a "real ROAS" from a non-PURCHASE event count.

---

## Rule 2 — Tool-Call Ordering: Verify Then Recommend

When the user asks for an optimization-event recommendation (e.g., "should I switch this to PURCHASE?"), the agent must call tools in this order:

1. **First**, fetch the campaign / ad set's current `optimization_goal` and `custom_event_type` (if any).
2. **Second**, fetch the volume of the corresponding events from the pixel/dataset over a meaningful window (≥7 days, ≥30 events ideally).
3. **Third**, fetch the volume of `PURCHASE` events over the same window for comparison.
4. **Only then** make a recommendation.

Do NOT recommend changing the optimization event without seeing both event volumes. A "switch to PURCHASE" recommendation on an account that gets 4 purchases/week is worse than the current CR optimization.

---

## Rule 2.5 — Profitmetrics / 3rd-Party Tracker Pre-Check Gate (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**This rule supersedes Rules 1, 2, 3, and 4 when its trigger fires. It must run before any other recommendation logic.**

**Trigger:** A campaign or ad set being analyzed has BOTH:
1. `optimization_goal` / `promoted_object.custom_event_type` = `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION`, AND
2. Campaign `objective` is a purchase-oriented objective (`OUTCOME_SALES`, `CONVERSIONS`, `PURCHASES`, or any objective whose target is purchase).

**Required behavior:** Before issuing ANY recommendation involving that campaign (pause, archive, scale, budget change, optimization-event switch, audience change, creative change, bid change, structural change, or even "monitor"), the agent's FIRST tool call about that campaign MUST be a `user_input` call with the following framing.

**If account currency is `DKK` / `SEK` / `NOK` / `EUR` or the chat is in a Nordic language** (Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish), explicitly name Profitmetrics in the question:

> *(Danish example, agent must adapt to the chat language)* "Kampagnen `<campaign_name>` optimerer for `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` på et `OUTCOME_SALES`-objektiv. I Norden bruges denne konfiguration ofte, fordi en 3. parts profit-tracker (typisk **Profitmetrics**, men også Cosmise eller Triple Whale) sender purchase-events ind via `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION`-endpointet — i så fald ER CR jeres faktiske købs-event, og kampagnen er korrekt konfigureret. Er det tilfældet her? Eller er CR en separat registrerings-handling (newsletter / signup / form), så vi reelt har en mismatched optimeringskonfiguration?"

**For any other currency or language**, the agent must ask the equivalent question, naming the 3rd-party tracker category by name:

> "Campaign `<campaign_name>` optimizes for `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` on an `OUTCOME_SALES` objective. This configuration commonly means a 3rd-party profit/attribution tracker (Profitmetrics, Cosmise, Triple Whale, or similar) is routing purchase events through the `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` standard event — in which case `CR` IS your actual purchase event and the configuration is correct. Is that the case here, or is `CR` a separate registration action (signup / newsletter / form completion) and we have a genuinely mismatched optimization?"

**Forbidden** while this rule is in pending state (i.e., the user_input has not been answered):
- Any `submit_recommendations` entry referencing the CR-on-purchase-objective campaign.
- Any `facebook_propose_update_*` call against the CR-on-purchase-objective campaign.
- Any volume-based reasoning from Rule 3 about that campaign.
- Statements like "low signal", "learning phase not exited", "consider pausing", "consolidate budget", or any equivalent in any language about that campaign.

**After the user answers:**
- If user confirms CR is the 3rd-party tracker's purchase proxy → treat the campaign as correctly configured. Do NOT recommend pause / optimization-event change. Audit on the basis that CR-count IS the purchase-count for this account.
- If user confirms CR is a true registration event (signup/form) → THEN apply Rules 1, 2, 3, 4 normally.

**Why this rule exists.** In the bug this skill blocks, a Danish account using Profitmetrics had a correctly-configured campaign paused based on a literal reading of `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` as "registration ≠ purchase." Volume-based reasoning ("only 5 conversions/month, learning phase not exited") arrives at the same destructive outcome from a different path and is equally forbidden until the configuration is verified with the user.

## Rule 3 — Volume-Based Optimization Event Heuristic

Before recommending an optimization-event change to PURCHASE:

| Weekly PURCHASE volume in pixel | Recommendation |
|--------------------------------|----------------|
| ≥ 50 / week per ad set | PURCHASE optimization viable. Recommend switch if cost-per-purchase signal is healthy. |
| 25–49 / week per ad set | PURCHASE optimization borderline. Stay on current event OR test PURCHASE on one ad set, do not migrate the whole campaign. |
| < 25 / week per ad set | Do NOT recommend PURCHASE optimization. Learning phase will not exit; spend will misallocate. Recommend continuing on the upper-funnel event (CR / IC / ATC) and improving funnel conversion downstream. |

Apply this heuristic BEFORE writing any "switch to PURCHASE" advice. If the data is not available in this turn, state the requirement before recommending.

---

## Rule 4 — Forbidden Phrasings

The agent must NOT produce these phrasings when interpreting a non-PURCHASE event:

**English:**
- "You had X purchases" (when X is CR / LEAD / SUBSCRIBE count).
- "Revenue from this campaign was $X" (when computed from a non-PURCHASE event).
- "This campaign is profitable" (judged on CR-only data).
- "Switch the optimization goal to PURCHASE" (without volume verification).
- "Skift optimeringsmål til PURCHASE" / "skift optimering til PURCHASE" — same recommendation in Danish, same prohibition.
- "Your ROAS is X" (using CR-event count multiplied by AOV — that is not ROAS).

**Danish (common Danish-language failure phrases observed in R5a):**
- "skift optimeringsmål til PURCHASE"
- "skift optimering til køb"
- "skift hændelsen til Køb"
- "konverteringerne her er ikke køb, men… [then proceeds to compute revenue anyway]" — the disclaimer does not absolve the error.

If the optimization-event change is the right answer, it must be supported by Rule 3's volume check first.

---

## Rule 5 — Required Language Templates

When the user asks "how is this campaign doing?" and the campaign optimizes for a non-PURCHASE event:
> "This campaign optimizes for `[EVENT_NAME]`, not Purchase. What I can tell you: [N] `[EVENT_NAME]` events at [$X] CPA over [window]. I can't compute revenue or ROAS from this directly — Purchase is a separate event in your pixel. Want me to pull Purchase volume over the same window to see how the funnel is converting downstream?"

When the user asks "should I scale this?" on a non-PURCHASE-optimized campaign:
> "Before scaling, I'd want to confirm: this campaign is optimizing for `[EVENT_NAME]`. Pulling Purchase volume for the same window — [N] purchases at [$Y] cost-per-purchase. With [N] weekly purchases account-wide, [PURCHASE-optimization viable / not yet viable] per Meta's learning-phase requirements. Recommended next step: [continue on current event / test PURCHASE on one ad set / improve downstream funnel]."

When the user asks "what's my CPA?" without specifying:
> "CPA depends on which event we're counting. For `[EVENT_NAME]` (the current optimization): $[X]. For `PURCHASE` (the actual sale event): $[Y]. These are different metrics — which one are you tracking against?"

---

## High-Risk Event List

The following Meta standard events are FREQUENTLY misread as purchase / revenue signals. Treat with skepticism — verify volume + meaning before recommending optimization changes:

- `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` — most commonly misread; can mean signup, completed-step-N, or checkout-finished depending on account.
- `LEAD` — almost never equal to revenue; lead → close rate varies wildly.
- `SUBSCRIBE` — recurring revenue start, not a one-time purchase.
- `START_TRIAL` — trial-to-paid conversion is account-specific.
- `SUBMIT_APPLICATION` — applications ≠ approved customers.
- `INITIATE_CHECKOUT` (IC) — frequently confused with purchase; can drop off 50%+.
- `ADD_TO_CART` (ATC) — upper-funnel, drops off heavily.
- `VIEW_CONTENT` — viewing-only signal.
- `SCHEDULE` — scheduled ≠ showed-up ≠ paid.
- `CONTACT` — contacts ≠ leads ≠ customers.
- `CUSTOMIZE_PRODUCT` — engagement, not purchase.
- `DONATE` — actual conversion in non-profit accounts but verify (could be a "Donate" button click event).
- `FIND_LOCATION` — store-visit intent, not visit.
- `OTHER` / custom event names — meaning is whatever the merchant chose. ALWAYS verify.

## Example: Correct vs Incorrect Response Patterns

**Scenario A (R5a-like, the bug this skill blocks)** — Danish account, DKK currency. Campaign `(markant) Samlet kampagne` has `objective = OUTCOME_SALES` and `promoted_object.custom_event_type = COMPLETE_REGISTRATION`, 5 monthly CR events, ROAS 2.45x. User asks for performance overview (in Danish).

❌ INCORRECT — literal interpretation (treats CR as registration, recommends switch):
> "Kampagnen genererer 5 registreringer til høj CPA. Jeg vil anbefale at skifte optimeringsmål til PURCHASE for at fokusere på faktiske køb."

❌ ALSO INCORRECT — volume-based reasoning (different path, same destructive outcome):
> "Med kun 5 månedlige konverteringer og COMPLETE_REGISTRATION som optimeringsmål har algoritmen ikke nok signal til at forlade learning-fasen. Overvej at pause kampagnen og konsolidere budgettet."

✅ CORRECT — Rule 2.5 fires, agent issues `user_input` FIRST before any recommendation:
> *Tool call: `user_input` with question:*
> "Kampagnen `(markant) Samlet kampagne` optimerer for `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` på et `OUTCOME_SALES`-objektiv. I Norden bruges denne konfiguration ofte, fordi en 3. parts profit-tracker (typisk **Profitmetrics**, men også Cosmise eller Triple Whale) sender purchase-events ind via `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION`-endpointet — i så fald er CR jeres faktiske købs-event, og kampagnen er korrekt konfigureret. Er det tilfældet her, eller er CR en separat registrerings-handling (signup / newsletter / form)?"
>
> *(Agent does NOT issue any `submit_recommendations` entry mentioning this campaign, does NOT use the volume-threshold reasoning, does NOT include it in the "campaigns to improve" list — until the user answers.)*

If user replies "ja, vi bruger Profitmetrics" → agent re-audits treating CR-count as purchase-count. No pause recommendation, no optimization-event switch.

If user replies "nej, CR er vores nyhedsbrevs-signup" → only THEN does Rule 3's volume gate apply and the agent may make a recommendation about the genuine event mismatch.

**Scenario B** — Campaign optimizes for LEAD. User asks "what's my CPA?"

❌ INCORRECT:
> "Your CPA is $34."

✅ CORRECT:
> "Cost per LEAD (current optimization event): $34. For reference, your account has [N] customer-close events per week — if you want true cost-per-customer, the funnel close rate from LEAD → customer is the multiplier."

**Scenario C** — Campaign optimizes for COMPLETE_REGISTRATION. Pixel shows 8 Purchase events/week total. User: "should I switch to PURCHASE optimization?"

❌ INCORRECT:
> "Yes, switch — Purchase is the better optimization target."

✅ CORRECT:
> "Not yet. Your pixel is recording ~8 Purchase events / week, which is well below Meta's ~50/week-per-ad-set threshold to exit learning on PURCHASE optimization. Switching now would scatter delivery and likely raise CPA. Recommended: stay on COMPLETE_REGISTRATION as the proxy signal, and work on downstream funnel conversion (CR → Purchase rate) to grow Purchase volume to the point PURCHASE optimization becomes viable."

**Scenario D** — User: "Convert this CR count to revenue at our $50 AOV."

❌ INCORRECT:
> "47 registrations × $50 AOV = $2,350 revenue."

✅ CORRECT:
> "CR ≠ Purchase, so 47 × AOV is not revenue. If you want estimated revenue from this campaign, I'd need: (a) the CR → Purchase rate from your pixel (or your CRM), and (b) the average order value among CR-attributed purchases specifically. Want me to pull those?"

## Mandatory Safety Check (before publishing)

Before any output that:
- Cites CPA / conversion count / "performance" for a campaign with non-PURCHASE optimization, OR
- Recommends an optimization-event change, OR
- Computes a revenue / ROAS figure from event counts

Verify:
- [ ] What event is the campaign actually optimizing for? Have I named it?
- [ ] **Rule 2.5 check:** Does this campaign have `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` on a purchase-oriented objective (`OUTCOME_SALES` / `CONVERSIONS` / `PURCHASES`)? If YES, have I already issued a `user_input` asking about Profitmetrics / 3rd-party tracker AND received an answer? If not — STOP. The next tool call must be `user_input`, no recommendation may include this campaign.
- [ ] Am I treating this event as a proxy for purchase / revenue? (If yes — stop.)
- [ ] If recommending an event switch, have I checked the destination-event volume against the Rule 3 threshold?
- [ ] If the account is in a non-English language (Danish, German, Spanish, etc.), am I avoiding the localized forbidden phrasings too?
- [ ] Is any recommendation about this campaign framed as "low signal / learning phase / consolidate / pause" while Rule 2.5's pre-check is still pending? If yes — STOP.

If any check fails: do not publish. Pull the missing data first.
