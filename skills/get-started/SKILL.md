description: "Use at the start of any GoMarble session or when the user asks what GoMarble can do, which accounts are connected, how to connect a platform, what GoMarble remembers about an account, or how approvals work. Also the reference for the GoMarble connector's call rules: account IDs, currency, pagination, async reports, memory, and the dry-run then live approval flow."

# Get started with GoMarble

GoMarble is the AI agent for paid media teams. Through the GoMarble connector, the model can read the ad accounts, analytics and store data the user connected in GoMarble, analyze them with GoMarble's methodology, propose account changes for approval, and set up agents that keep watching on a schedule.

## 1. Check the connection

If GoMarble tools aren't available, the connector isn't signed in. The user signs in from their AI app's connector settings. In Claude Code they run `/mcp`, pick the GoMarble server and choose **Authenticate**; in Codex they run `codex mcp login gomarble`. Sign-in happens on apps.gomarble.ai and lasts 30 days.

The connection works in the team the user has selected in the GoMarble web app, with that person's role and account access (see `access-and-permissions`).

## 2. Find the accounts

List what's connected before analyzing anything. Use IDs exactly as returned. Each list tool returns `configured_accounts` (the accounts saved in GoMarble that this user can use) alongside everything the platform connection can see. Calling a tool on a visible account that isn't configured adds it to GoMarble and uses a plan slot, so confirm first (see `accounts-and-connections`).

| Platform | List tool |
|---|---|
| Meta Ads | `facebook_list_ad_accounts` |
| Google Ads | `google_ads_list_accounts` (includes manager/MCC context) |
| TikTok Ads | `tiktok_list_ad_accounts`, `tiktok_list_business_centers` |
| LinkedIn Ads | `linkedin_list_ad_accounts` |
| Microsoft Ads | `bing_ads_list_accounts` |
| GA4 | `google_analytics_list_properties` |
| Search Console | `gsc_list_properties` |
| Shopify | `shopify_list_shops` |
| Klaviyo | `klaviyo_list_shops` |
| Facebook Pages / Instagram | `facebook_page_list`, `instagram_list_accounts` |
| Impact | `impact_list_accounts` |

If the user names a brand, match it to an account and confirm when more than one fits. If a platform or tool they need isn't connected, use `accounts-and-connections`: native platforms are added at apps.gomarble.ai/settings/integrations, and other tools (HubSpot, Notion, BigQuery…) through `discover_connectors`, whose `connect_url` you share as a link.

## 3. Use what GoMarble already knows

Call `recall_memory` before analyzing or recommending on an account, and whenever a new account or entity comes up. It returns past findings, decisions, baselines and brand context.

- Make one call per account, per entity and per distinct question. Filter with `accountIds` when you know the account.
- Phrase the query the way the record would be written, not the user's words. For "how is Acme doing lately?", ask for "Acme ROAS drop / decline / what changed".
- Use `depth: "deep"` for strategy or "everything we know about this brand" questions.

## 4. How changes work

Nothing changes in an ad account without the user's approval.

1. Call the `*_propose_*` tool with `mode: "dryrun"` (the default). GoMarble validates the change and returns `operation_ids`. Nothing changes yet.
2. Show the user each proposed change: the entity, the current value and the new value.
3. After an explicit yes, call the same tool with `mode: "live"`, the `account_id` from the dry run, and only the approved `operation_ids`. Don't resend the entity fields.

Rules:
- Put one field change per item, so each can be approved or rejected on its own.
- Pass budgets and bids in account currency (50 means $50). The tools convert internally. Always pass `currency_code`.
- New ads are created paused by default.
- Applying changes needs Act access on the account, a read & write platform connection, the connector's write permission for that platform, and a plan with write actions. If any is missing, the tool says which; handle it with `access-and-permissions` and offer the recommendation meanwhile.

## 5. Call rules that prevent wrong numbers

- **Currency first.** Meta: `facebook_get_details_of_ad_account`. Google: `google_ads_get_currency`. TikTok: `tiktok_get_account_details`. Never assume USD.
- **Paginate before totals.** When a Meta response has `paging.next`, call `facebook_fetch_pagination_url` until it's complete. Pages use `facebook_page_fetch_pagination_url`, and TikTok uses `tiktok_fetch_pagination`. Don't total or rank partial data.
- **Large pulls run async.** Use `facebook_get_async_adaccount_insights` or `tiktok_get_async_report` for big date ranges or many breakdowns, then read the result they return.
- **Fresh state before recommending.** Campaigns change often. Re-read current state before proposing a change.

## 6. GoMarble's own methodology

This plugin ships GoMarble's skills as files, synced from the same source the connector's `load_skill` tool serves. Prefer the plugin's skills. Call `load_skill` only when a connector tool says it's required before the call, or you need a GoMarble skill path the plugin doesn't include.
